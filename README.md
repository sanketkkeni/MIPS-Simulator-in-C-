# MIPS-Simulator
==============


The program takes in the input file (e.g. sample.txt), MIPS instructions in binary format separated by new lines, at the command line upon running the compiled program.

It outputs a disassembly.txt and simulation.txt file, showing the contents of the memory registers upon program initialization and the MIPS instruction(s) execution, respectively.
